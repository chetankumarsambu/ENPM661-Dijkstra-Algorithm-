To run the code, download chetan27_proj2_code.py for point robots respectively. Dependencies- numpy, heapq, math

When you run chetan27_proj2_code.py, you will get an input request for initial node x, initial node y, goal node x, goal node y.

Image of the backtracking path is shown with blue path representing the Shortest path and the green plane representing the explored nodes.
